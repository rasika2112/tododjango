# django-JUSTDo



JustDo - is not only your simple todolist which allows one to mark completed or uncompleted tasks and also to delete a specific task. 
We can rename a particular task.
The list also shows you the current-day task and one can also list down the future tasks and manage them or see them by specifying the date.
Teammates - Vaibhavi Kundle and Rasika Joshi.
